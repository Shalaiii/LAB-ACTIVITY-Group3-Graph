# INTRODUCE WHAT IS IT

This Roadmap application represents a roadmap system using an undirected weighted graph, where locations are vertices and roads are edges with distances as weights. It helps visualize and understand how locations are interconnected.

# WHAT IT CAN DO

It can add locations to the map, connect locations with roads specifying distances, and display the roadmap as an interactive network.

# WHY MAKE THIS APPLICATION AND HOW DOES IT CONTRIBUTE TO ME AND TO THE COMMUNITY

As a student, I created this application to explore the concept of graph data structures and their real-world applications. The application simulates a roadmap, allowing users to add locations, connect them with roads, and display the entire network. This project helped me learn about graph theory and algorithms by applying them to a practical use case. Roadmaps are intuitive examples of graph structures and are highly relevant in applications like GPS systems, route optimization, and urban planning. For me, it enhances my problem-solving skills and strengthens my understanding of data structures. For the community, it showcases how programming can be used to solve real-world problems like mapping, navigation, and logistics, serving as a foundation for more advanced tools like route optimizers or travel planners. It also demonstrates the value of learning coding concepts in making practical applications.
