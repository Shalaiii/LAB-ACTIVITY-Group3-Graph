# Roadmap

INTRODUCE WHAT IS IT

This Roadmap application represents a roadmap system using an undirected weighted graph, where locations are vertices and roads are edges with distances as weights. It helps visualize and understand how locations are interconnected.

WHAT IT CAN DO

It can add locations to the map, connect locations with roads specifying distances, and display the roadmap as an interactive network.

WHY MAKE THIS APPLICATION AND HOW DOES IT CONTRIBUTE TO ME AND TO THE COMMUNITY

As a student, I created this application to explore the concept of graph data structures and their real-world applications. The application simulates a roadmap, allowing users to add locations, connect them with roads, and display the entire network. This project helped me learn about graph theory and algorithms by applying them to a practical use case. Roadmaps are intuitive examples of graph structures and are highly relevant in applications like GPS systems, route optimization, and urban planning. For me, it enhances my problem-solving skills and strengthens my understanding of data structures. For the community, it showcases how programming can be used to solve real-world problems like mapping, navigation, and logistics, serving as a foundation for more advanced tools like route optimizers or travel planners. It also demonstrates the value of learning coding concepts in making practical applications.
